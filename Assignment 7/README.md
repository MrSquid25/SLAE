# Assignment 7

## What to do

• Create a custom crypter like the one shown in the “crypters” video 

• Free to use any existing encryption schema 

• Can use any programming language

## Solutions

Crypter selected: [AES CBC Mode] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)

Programming language used: Python 2.7

Python modules needed: [PyCrytodome] (https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

There are three files:

1) aes_shellcode_cipher.py 

2) aes_decode_cipher.py

3) main.sh

      Script which given a shellcode, ciphers and deciphers it using the python scripts showed before
